# minimal-calci
A simple android calculator with phone dialer key layout.

Motivation: I wanted to explore a different and more minilistic key layout for calculator while maintaining its fundtionality.

I thought that phone dialer has a perfect key layout for a calculator as 
1. user needs to enter long numbers (10-digit phone numbers)
2. such layout is being used by standard phone dialers not only in android but also in iOS.

The operator keys are placed above the operand key block unlike other calculators (where they are placed on right side). The operator block is a horizontal scrollable element with other operators accessible to the user with scrolling.
