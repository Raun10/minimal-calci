# minimal-calci
A simple android calculator with phone dialer key layout.

Motivation: I wanted to explore a differentand more minilistic key layout for calcultor while maintaining its fundtionality.

I thought that phone dialer has a perfect key layout for a calculator as 
1. user needs to enter long numbers (10-digit phone numbers)
2. such layout is being used by standard phone dialers not only in android but also in iOS.
